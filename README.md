## 🧠 About Me

I’m passionate about defending digital infrastructure and exploring both offensive and defensive security. I began my journey in cybersecurity when I witnessed a hack on my father's ministry website. Since then, I’ve been diving deep into:

- Linux hardening
- Scoring engines
- Proxmox cyber ranges
- Network forensics
- Blue team defense and red team tactics

I participate in competitions like:
- NCAE-C Cyber Games

## 🚀 Projects
🔒 DWAYNE-INATOR-5000 Custom Scoreboard & Proxmox Cyber Range
A fully customized, Matrix-themed CTF scoreboard built for the DWAYNE-INATOR-5000, complete with glowing UI elements, animated Matrix canvas background, and dark red hacker aesthetics. Uses TOML-based configuration to score SSH, FTP, DNS, and Web services in real time.

Hosted on a Proxmox-powered datacenter running on my personal machine (AMD Ryzen 9 5950X, 96GB RAM, 20TB storage, RTX 3090 Ti).

Scoring engine deployed in LXC containers with ZeroTier for remote connectivity.
Integrated with custom Linux VMs ("deimos" and "eris") and real-world service configurations.
GitHub-hosted, easily replicable, and styled to match a cyberpunk-themed competition aesthetic.
