## 🧠 About Me

I’m passionate about defending digital infrastructure and exploring both offensive and defensive security. I began my journey in cybersecurity when I witnessed a hack on my father's ministry website. Since then, I’ve been diving deep into:

- Linux hardening
- Scoring engines
- Proxmox cyber ranges
- Network forensics
- Blue team defense and red team tactics

I participate in competitions like:
- NCAE-C Cyber Games
